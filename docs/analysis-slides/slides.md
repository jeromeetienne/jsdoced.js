# The Good

--

### The more you document your code the safer it become

- Documenting doc is good for your devs
- Testing is good for your users

**Create Virtuous cycle !**

--

### Tested During Execution

* Javascript is a dynamic language
* it has to be tested during execution

**Tests are done when they need to be**

--

### It detects a new family of error 

* jsdoc provide plenty of useful information
* it was rarely/never use to test code

**Expand test coverage !!!**

--

# The Bad

--

### Slow down execution

* All those checking costs time
* not that important during the test phase tho
  * don't use it in production

It is like a [debug build](http://vinayakgarg.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/difference-between-debug-build-and-release-build/)
